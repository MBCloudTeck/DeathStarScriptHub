# PowerAL

Current version: 0.95

Version control will not be 100% until I have reached version 1.0.
I use this area as my work area to commit my code. After version 1.0 I will be using a DEV branch instead
for rolling changes.

PowerAL is a Powershell module for interacting with AppLocker rules.
Module is designed to be able to run in Constrained language mode.
The goal with the module is to easily be able to identify AppLocker weaknesses/config flaws.
This module is a work in progress. First version (0.63) was released at DerbyCon.
